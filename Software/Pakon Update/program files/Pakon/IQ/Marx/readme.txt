*************************************************************************
Overview
*************************************************************************

The tool was designed to help MARX customers simplify troubleshooting of 
MARX hardware. The tool performs extensive diagnostics of the operating 
system, analyzes which MARX DLLs and device drivers are installed and 
running for each model of MARX hardware, tests found Marx hardware and 
automatically downloads missing files via the Internet and installs them 
on the local machine.
*************************************************************************
Key Features
*************************************************************************

The following features are implemented in the current version of MarxProbe:

+ Analysis of installed MARX APIs, DLLs and device drivers. In Win2K/XP/NT if
  a device driver is installed but has not started, the application attempts
  to start it immediately without the need to reboot the PC!

+ Detection of MARX hardware

+ Complete testing of found Marx hardware (optional, requires proper MRX file)

+ Detection of port addressing in Windows 98/Me/2000/XP

+ Download via Internet and installation of missing MARX components. In 
WinNT there is no need to reboot the PC after device drivers are installed! 
If the user does not have Administrative rights an error message will be
displayed

+ LiveUpdate via Internet for MarxProbe itself

+ Troubleshooting information. When a problem is detected, an explanation 
is provided of what should be done

+ Report generation. A report can be saved to a file or e-mailed right from 
the application

I couldn't find much information on this, so here's a rough guide as a starting point.
Please edit, update and refine :)
0) Turn on PAKON
1) Open TLXClientDemo (in Start menu -> Programs -> Pakon -> TLXClientDemo)
2) Click the SCAN button on the left and the SCAN SETTINGS dialog box appears.  Then click SCAN*
3) The scanner starts to run, feed your film in
4) When scanning is complete, click "Move Oldest Roll in Scan Group to Save Group", then a Scan Warnings box will appears with a summary of the scan information, click OK.
5) Click the FRAMING button on the left, Framing Adjustment dialog box will appear, change the LEFT value and click APPLY until the left of the frame lines up
6) Click on the "Adjust Cropping" radio button on the left, and then change the Right value and click Apply, keeping adjusting the number until it's framed the way you want.  I usually start with the Right value as Left Value + 5440, and then adjust from there. Click OK when you're happy with it.
7) Click on the Color button if you want to make adjustments to the brightness/contrast/colour/sharpening
8) Click the NEXT button on the right to go to the next frame.
9) Repeat Steps 5 - 8 for the remaining frames, clicking the Delete Picture button for the frames you don't want.
10) Click on the SAVE button, and the save dialog box will appear.  I select "All pictures", "To disk", "JPEG". Then OK.
11) The scans appear in c:\TEMP
I took screenshots but don't know how to embed them in this document!
*If you have an error here, try reinstalling the Pakon software, this fixed the problem for me!

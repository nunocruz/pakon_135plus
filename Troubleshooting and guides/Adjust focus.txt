1. Remove 4 torx screws on bottom of scanner

2. Remove all the remaining philips screws that are holding the white plastic top part on to the metal base (can't remember if there are 4 or 6 of these) and remove the top plastic 

3. Loosen the screws that hold the film transport down, and gently adjust the entire film transport mechanism so that it's perfectly aligned to the flat bar behind it with a "no touch" sticker.

4.Tighten screws and put scanner back together. Scanners were calibrated at the factory by adjusting the no-touch bar to the proper focus position. The film transport sometimes shifts away from it. Do not attempt to loosen or adjust the no-touch bar.

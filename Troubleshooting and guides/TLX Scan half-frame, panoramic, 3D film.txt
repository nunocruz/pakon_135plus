This solution does not require manual adjustment of framing for each image after scanning. Once you determine the correct Pre-Scan values for your camera, scan your film, wait (sip your coffee / tea), then make color adjusments and save your images.
Open TLX
Go to "Pre-Scan" (menu) and select "35mm 16 Base"
Under "Framing", set "Width (px)" to something appropriate (try 1500 for half frame, 5500 for panoramic)
Set "Unit Width (px)" to 206 greater than "Width (px)" was set to
Under "Cropping", set "Right (pixels)" to 1 less than "Width (px)"
Click OK
Click Scan
Set all your usual preferences
Click Scan. You may need to re-scan if your "Width (px)" value was not quite right. Unfortunately, TLX does not seem to support changing these values and re-framing the roll after it has been scanned.
 
Example calculations (your camera may require different values):
 
Panoramic frame with average frame width of 5500 px
Width (px): 5500
Unit Width (px): 5706 = 5500 + 206
Cropping -> Right (pixels): 5499 = 5500 - 1 

Hasselblad XPAN (original)
Width (px): 5530
Unit Width (px): 5736 = 5530 + 206
Cropping -> Right (pixels): 5529 = 5530 - 1 

Hasselblad XPAN II
Width (px): 5465
Unit Width (px): 5585
Cropping -> Right (pixels): 5464 = 5465 - 1

Half-frame (NOT universal values, just a place to start from):
Width (px): 1500
Unit Width (px): 1706 = 1500 + 206
Cropping -> Right (pixels): 1499 = 1500 - 1

 Type 126 film (not recently tested, but values pulled from an old group post):
Width (px): 2630
Unit Width (px): 2660 = 2630 + 30
Cropping -> Right (pixels): 2629 = 2630 - 1 

Horizon 202
Width (px): 4925
Unit Width (px): 5000
Cropping -> Left (pixels): 10
Cropping -> Right (pixels): 4880
Cropping -> Top (pixels): 20
Cropping -> Bottom (pixels): 1999 

Horizon Perfekt
Width (px): 5025
Unit Width (px): 5100
Cropping -> Left (pixels): 10
Cropping -> Right (pixels): 4880
Cropping -> Top (pixels): 20
Cropping -> Bottom (pixels): 1999

Widelux
Width (px): 4910
Unit Width (px): 5350
Cropping -> Right (pixels): 4909 
Revere Stereo 33
Width (px): 2040
Unit Width (px): 2246
Cropping -> Right (pixels): 2039

How to guess a frame width to start with
Grab a metric ruler with millimeter markings
Measure the length of 1 (or more) frame(s) of your film along the sprockets (diptychs, triptychs, etc)
Perform this calculation:
(Long side length in mm) / 25.4mm  *  2000dpi  = framing width dpi  
Example: XPan (65mm x 24mm):
65mm/25.4mm * 2000dpi = 5118dpi
